                                            Processing in parallel can cause

                                            concurrency mode. This guarantees

                                            a time. Note that using this
                                            option may significantly increase
                                            the processing time for a job.

                                  installation.
            types (array): The type of component being retrieved. You can build
                           the types with the get_package_type_members() method.
            uninstall_class (str): The name of the Apex class that specifies
                                   the actions to execute after the package has
                                   been uninstalled. The Apex class must be a

                                        a deployment can still succeed.

                                        specified in package.xml, specifies whether
                                        the file is automatically added to the
                                        package. A retrieve() is issued with the

            check_only (bool): Defaults to false. Set to true to perform a
                               test deployment (validation) of components
                               without saving the components in the target
                               org. A validation enables you to verify the

                               rerunning tests. See deployRecentValidation().

                                    or not (false). Defaults to false.

                                        -problem—The text of the warning.
                                    If a warning occurs and ignoreWarnings is
                                    set to true, the success field in
                                    DeployMessage is true. If ignoreWarnings is

                                    the warning is treated like an error.
            perform_retrieve (bool): Indicates whether a retrieve() call is
                                     performed immediately after the deployment
                                     (true) or not (false). Set to true in order
                                     to retrieve whatever was just deployed.

                                    stored in the Recycle Bin. Instead, they

                                    production orgs.
            rollback_on_error (bool): Indicates whether any failure causes a
                                      complete rollback (true) or not (false). If
                                      false, whatever actions can be performed
                                      without errors are performed, and errors are
                                      returned for the remaining actions. This
                                      parameter must be set to true if you are
                                      deploying to a production org. The default
                                      is false.
            run_tests (array): A list of Apex tests to run during
                               deployment. Specify the class name, one name
                               per instance. The class name can also
                               specify a namespace with a dot notation. For
                               more information, see Running a Subset of
                               Tests in a Deployment.
                               To use this option, set testLevel to
                               RunSpecifiedTests.
            single_package (bool): Indicates whether the specified .zip file
                                   points to a directory structure with a
                                   single package (true) or a set of packages
                                   (false).
            test_level (str): Optional. Specifies which tests are run as
                              part of a deployment. The test level is
                              enforced regardless of the types of
                              components that are present in the deployment
                              package. Valid values are:
                                  -NoTestRun—No tests are run. This test
                                  level applies only to deployments to
                                  development environments, such as
                                  sandbox, Developer Edition, or trial
                                  organizations. This test level is the
                                  default for development environments.
                                  -RunSpecifiedTests—Only the tests that
                                  you specify in the runTests option are
                                  run. Code coverage requirements differ
                                  from the default coverage requirements
                                  when using this test level. Each class
                                  and trigger in the deployment package
                                  must be covered by the executed tests
                                  for a minimum of 75% code coverage.
                                  This coverage is computed for each
                                  class and trigger individually and is
                                  different than the overall coverage
                                  percentage.
                                  -RunLocalTests—All tests in your org are
                                  run, except the ones that originate
                                  from installed managed packages. This
                                  test level is the default for production
                                  deployments that include Apex classes
                                  or triggers.
                                  -RunAllTestsInOrg—All tests are run. The
                                  tests include all tests in your org,
                                  including tests of managed packages.
